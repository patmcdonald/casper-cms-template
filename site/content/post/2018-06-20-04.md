title: 4. How I made my site

To familiarise myself with static site generators, I first read through [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) blog and tutorials.

I was already aware of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but I googled generators a bit more, and found that[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) seemed to be faster, popular and there was an abundance of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw/playlists?sort=dd&view=50&shelf_id=2) out there too.

I had considered using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but I'm not familiar enough with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) yet, so I'll be revisiting it soon; it's really impressive in what it can do.

I made an attempt to use [ForestryCMS](https://forestry.io/#/) with my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, but I came upon some build errors. As I was under time constraints; I updated my previous Hugo site via GitHub, rather than add delay.

I'll certainly be setting up static sites with different CMS options in the near future (both open source and proprietary), to test them out.
