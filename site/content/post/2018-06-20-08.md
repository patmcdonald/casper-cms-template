Hi [customer_name],

Thanks for reaching out to us, that's a real pain when it happens! If you haven't read it already; we've put together this [support doc](https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/) that will guide you through problems that can come up occasionally. It's likely the solution for your build is there.

If your site still won't build after going through the steps outlined, I'll need some more details to get you going. If you copy the displayed output in your site deploy log and send it to us in a reply to this email, that would be really helpful to me in getting your site deployed ASAP.

Kind regards.

Pat @netlify
