I first came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), via your initial job posting 6 months ago.

For me, it was a whole new concept in web development and hosting. After digging into it, I can see how amazing it is. I certainly find that there's a steep learning curve with static site generators. 

It took some searching for me to settle on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this task. Then, a [CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) that makes it easy to add content. Many users expect this, given how popular hosted solutions like [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) are. 

It didn't suck! The [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) UI makes it simple to get a site up. That's a great start for a beginner. Once they get momentum, they can develop their site, and go onwards and upwards.

The future of the web has [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) written all over it, IMHO:)
