title: Hey Chris!

Here's my selection from your [support-tasks gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6/raw/15f37be99e4fc3eb8caffa954472240a2a70847d/gistfile1.md).
To be honest, I found it hard to list my least favourite activities. Really!

My 5 favourite activities from this list are:

1. Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model

2. Respond to 60+ support requests via email or chat every day

3. Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems

4. Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before

5. Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging



My 5 least favourite activities from this list are:

1. Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product

2. Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter

3. Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.

4. Help manage communications during a service outage

5. Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub


###My favourite thing about providing technical support?

I love helping people really *get* something.

That something can be a new concept to them, such as [Markdown](http://markdown-here.com/) instead of HTML or [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) instead of a hosted solution like [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) or [.org](https://wordpress.org/).

I've always done this in my work and daily life. Helping people to learn a new skill, or maintain an already learned one. This can be showing my kids how to use a spelling app, a disabled elder in using a sensory stimulation app on their iPad, or a basic life skill like getting dressed.

This is my life's work, and Technical Support challenges me. It pushes me to learn and master new technologies, so I can be confident in supporting others to make their best use of it. 

Constant learning, and the sharing of that learning, is my path in life!
