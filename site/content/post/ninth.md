Hi [customer_name],

Thanks for getting in contact with us!
That's a real pain when it happens. I've been right there! But, with the vast site generator ecosystem  we support, this happens sometimes. 

If you haven't read it already; we've put together this [support doc](https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/) that will guide you through problems that can come up occassionally. It's likely the solution to your build is in there.

If your site still won't build after going through the steps outlined, I'll need some more details to get you going. If there are any console or GUI messages that are displayed after the build fails, please forward them onto us in a reply to this email. A screenshot or code snippet of the message(if any) will really help.

Kind regards.

Pat @netlify
