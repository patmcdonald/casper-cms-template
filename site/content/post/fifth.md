Chris, I got nothing! It's challenging; as it should be.
But, what I've really liked is learning and implementing cutting edge web technology.
The learning curve is steep, but worth the effort for me. 

I'm thinking of how I can make things easier for new users to get a site up and running. 
[Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) editor in a new CMS maybe?
