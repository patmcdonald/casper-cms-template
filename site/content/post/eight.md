title: 2 major challenges around DNS configuration.
---

DNS configuration can be challenging for non-technical users.

When I think back to the first time I set up a DNS record in cPanel, It was the naming of Address Record Types that confused me initially. The first time with A, AAAA, CNAME, MX records can be daunting to say the least! Factor in subdomains, URL Redirect, Wildcard records and SSL - thats a lot of jargon for a new user.

The right UI, supported by clear documentation can take a user through the steps needed to configure DNS.
If the UI isn't designed well, good support guides will help. But they won't be a panacea for a nightmare UX!

For example; here's my [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/434/2237/how-do-i-set-up-host-records-for-a-domain) and [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/) DNS docs. Clarity and simplicity make configuration as easy as possible.
