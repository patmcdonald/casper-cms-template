Chris, the test is still challenging, and I'm glad I did it again. I think the huge variety of tools I could choose makes each application quite unique maybe?
The job posting is beautifully written, in that it encouraged me to apply - even when I had minimal skills.

I'm definitely a bit more confident after this. I'm thinking of how I can contribute to an open source project in the static world now:-)
