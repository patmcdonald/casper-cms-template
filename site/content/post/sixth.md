As I'm presently learning Javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) has piqued my curiosity.

I think the Docs are very well done. The UI is nice and easy to navigate, and there's a [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010) example that gets you started pretty quickly.
The more advanced guides are in their own menu, this keeps me from going down the rabbit hole too early:]

Looking at these Docs and the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), Its easy to dive in. Learning React is on my list, after my current Javascript course.
