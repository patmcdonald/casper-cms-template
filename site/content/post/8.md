Hi [customer_name],

Thanks for reaching out to us!

That's a real pain when it happens; I've been right there! If you haven't read it already; we've put together this [support doc](https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/) that will guide you through problems that can come up occasionally. It's likely the solution for your build is there.

If your site still won't build after going through the steps outlined, I'll need some more details to get you going. If there are any console or GUI messages that are displayed after the build fails, please forward them onto us in a reply to this email. A screenshot or code snippet of the error message(if any) would be really helpful in getting your site deployed.

Kind regards.

Pat @netlify
