I first came across [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) over a year ago.

For me, it was a whole new concept in web development and hosting. After looking into [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/). I've found there's a steep learning curve with SSG's, but I've seen how prolific their [growth](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators) has been in that time.

It doesn't suck! The [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) UI makes it easy to get a static site up. That's a great start for a beginner: especially with [secure domain purchase and setup](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/06/19/buy-and-secure-a-custom-domain-through-netlify/) . Once they get momentum; they can develop their site, and dive deeper into development.

The future of the web is static!
