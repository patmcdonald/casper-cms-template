DNS configuration can be challenging for non-technical users.

Setting up a domain can be a little intimidating initially. Concepts like DNS [caching](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-cache-817514) and [propogation](https://www.name.com/support/articles/115012317827-Domain-Propagation) are frustrating for someone who just wants their spanky new webapp to work. Kudos to Netlify for integrating secure [domain purchase](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/06/19/buy-and-secure-a-custom-domain-through-netlify/) and setup!

When I think back to first time I set up a DNS record in cPanel, It was the naming of Address Record Types that confused me initially. The first time a less technical user tries to make sense of A, AAAA, CNAME, MX can be daunting to say the least! Factor in subdomains, URL Redirect, Wildcard records and SSL - thats a lot of jargon for a new user.

The right UI, supported by clear documentation can take a user through the steps needed to configure DNS.
If the UI isn't designed well, good support guides will help. But they won't be a panacea for an intimidating setup UX.
